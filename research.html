    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper surveys the main ingredients and results of heterogeneous firms trade policy literature that has been developing since the early 2000s. First, I present in great detail various stylized facts regarding firm heterogeneity, firm-level markups, and the global structure of multinational production. Second, I summarize the results of the recent development of theoretical approaches of modeling the firm-level markups. Third, I discuss the theoretical frameworks that incorporates multinational production into heterogeneous firms framework. Fourth, I review the trade policy literature that features firm heterogeneity, variable markups, and multinational production. Finally, I discuss directions for future research and offer suggestions for further readings. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper introduces ad valorem tariff and horizontal FDI into the Melitz and Ottaviano [2008] framework, producing the first framework in the trade policy literature that incorporates firm heterogeneity, variable markups, and multinational production. The model generates novel equilibrium implications. First, the presence of multinational production generates a competitive effect on the economy, and firms need to be more productive to survive the competition. Second, the ad valorem tariff and quadratic quasi-linear preference collectively result in an endogenous level of firm entry. Therefore, the impact of trade/tariff liberalization depends on the equilibrium number of firms. In the short-run, when the firm entry is prohibited, an increase in import tariff shields the domestic economy from the Foreign competition, making it easier for firms to survive. This result is overturned when firms can enter the market freely in the long-run. In the long-run, an increase in Home’s import tariff will make the Home country a more desirable environment to do business, attracting more entrants in the Home market, making the Home market more competitive. Firms need to be more productive to survive. Home’s tariff increase also makes it harder for the least productive Foreign exporters to survive, and triggers tariff-jumping FDI among the most productive exporters. Markups also respond to tariff change differently in the short-run vs. long-run, primarily due to the change of competitive environment associated with firm entry. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper studies the welfare implication of tariff and optimal tariffs in an environment features firm heterogeneity, variable markups and FDI. The findings can be broadly summarized in three aspects. First, the quadratic quasi-linear preference generates multiple externalities in this economy, causing market outcome to differ from the socially optimum outcome systematically. Permitting FDI lowers the domestic cutoff levels and reduces the misallocation in the economy. Second, free trade is not always socially optimal. If the domestic cutoff is sufficiently high, an additional firm entry can improve social welfare. In this case, a positive import tariff is welfare- improving because it encourages firm entry. Third, both positively and normatively, the interaction of variable markup and FDI generates novel trade policy insights that are absent if consumers possess CES preference. </div></p>

      Abstract

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

      Abstract

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
